The new Pact Plugins Framework is the next generation underpinning for the most highly adopted Pact contract testing specification! We are excited to share that we're expanding the Pact capability from RESTful HTTP messaging services to a multi-protocol approach - with plugins.

Multi-language support is both a benefit and a weakness for Pact in that the applicability of contract testing with Pact is broad but the effort to maintain all languages across all protocols is extensive and not scaleable without the plugin infrastructure.

Using the Plugins Framework, anyone can build a new component or adapter to use for/with contract testing without the burden of having to set up and manage the underlying framework.

Join Matt & Yousaf at one of two live webinars to learn about the Pact Plugin Framework, how you can now build you own plugin and ask any questions you may have.
