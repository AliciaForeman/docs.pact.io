The [Pact Broker Client CLI](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker-client) allows you to create, update, delete and query resources in a Pact Broker (including the `can-i-deploy` command). It is available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pactfoundation/pact-cli) and a [standalone executable](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker-client/releases).

You can find the documentation [here](/pact_broker/client_cli/readme).
