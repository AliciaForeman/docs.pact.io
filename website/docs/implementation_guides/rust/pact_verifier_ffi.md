**NOTE:** This library is being moved into a single FFI library [pact_ffi](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/blob/master/rust/pact_verifier_ffi/pact_ffi).

This project provides a foreign function interface to verify pact files against a running provider. It implements the [V3 Pact specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-3).
