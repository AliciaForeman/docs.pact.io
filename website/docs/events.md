## 19th Nov  - Online Pact Community Event

### Slides and Resources

[How maintainers use Pact - Tim Jones](/events/pact_online_community_20201119/2020_11_19_How_maintainers_use_pact_-_Tim_J_-_Pact_Community_Catchup.pdf)

### Questions from the night

#### Who typically writes and executes the Pact tests?

#### How can I tell if I have good coverage of an API with my pact tests?

#### Now that Pactflow exists, are you still going to be supporting the Pact Broker? There seems to be an obvious commercial conflict

#### I'm convinced, but I don't know how to get started. It all seems too hard. What advice do you have?

#### What are your tips for effectively writing and maintaining provider states?

#### How can I prevent probs with pacts on several branches. What are the best practices for keeping the FE and BE dev sync without disturbing other branches.

#### Can we get a status update on the progress of the Rust implementation?

#### When the payload is big and deeply nested, it's a little cumbersome to write PactDSLs by hand for the consumer. Are there any smart ways to do that?

#### Do PACT tests replace integration testing? If not, why do it at all?

#### How does Pact play with something like OAS?

#### Can I creat a contract describing several branches at an integration point? What if I want to ensure a green path and a red path (timeout, circuit breaker)?

#### Do you have plans to provide support for setting up multiple consumer contract tests on the provider side, for the server underlying calls?


#### Are there any situations where you would not recommend using Pact?

#### Does Pact support contract testing gRPC and Kafka? What languages are supported?

#### Don't you think that having all PACT support focus on slack keeps PACT "in the shadows" (what's solved there is not searchable from, say, google)

#### Why does Pact not support optionals?

#### I've seen in the docs the warning "don't try and use Pact for functional testing". Can you explain this further?

#### Can I use Pact to support UI testing?

### If Pact might be used to replace some unit tests, would that mean that we'd be using multiple states and scenarios where the ui may not care too much about it?

#### When is pact-reference stable? I mean releasing 1.0.0 and other projects e.g. pact-php start using it.

#### When can we expect async messaging contract testing support for ruby ?

#### On what level do you advise to mock the provider application: right after the getting request / service / database?

#### Is there a plan to centralise documentation, its hard to keep track of where to reach for a workshop of pact or read the PACT nirvana document.

#### I know that you are already working on gRPC support. Can you share some details and progress with us? Thanks

#### Clients prefer no code automation . One stakeholder liked karate as it supports BDD. We have given some presentations and demo also for PACT. How to convince?

#### Could you share your views on using Rest Assured together with pact tests?

#### Would you consider an error code(ie: INVALID_EMAIL) as part of the format? ie: { "error": { "code": "INVALID_EMAIL", message: "The email is invalid" } }

#### What is searching algorithm of stub-server to find the matched interaction?What if we have a thousand of contract files how can we improve searching performance

#### Is it possible to apply contract tests to check the communication between microservices via RabbitMQ? How could I check the queues?

#### Can you provide good/more examples for integrating pact into the pipeline(s) in the documentation? Some strategies would be nice (edited)

#### How to share request data between consumer and provider?To get data from user Matt by user ID 1, does the provider get this user ID from pact Context?
