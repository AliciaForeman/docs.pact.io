title: How to ask for help
---

The Pact maintainers and our band of experienced community members love helping you learn how to use Pact. Please remember that while you might be learning how to use Pact as part of your paid job, the _maintainers and community are helping you in their free time_, so please be respectful in the way that you seek assistance by following these steps when you have a question.

1. **Search on [docs.pact.io](https://docs.pact.io) first!** We have a great (free!) search tool provided by Algolia, and it's quicker than waiting for a human to respond. If you're trying to learn how to use Pact, check out our [Getting started](/getting_started/) section. If you're trying to learn how to use Pact *well*, check out our [Guides](/guides). If you're trying to learn how to use Pact in a particular language, check out our [implementation docs](/implementation_guides).

2. **Search on Slack.** We're on a free plan, so we don't have unlimited history, however, you may be able to find the answer to your question in the archives.

2. If you can't find your answer on the docs site or Slack, _then_ ask your question on [Slack](https://slack.pact.io). We support Pact tools written in more than 10 different languages, and each of the languages has it's own channel, so **find the appropriate channel for your question**. If you're new to the Slack workspace, you can browse the available channels by clicking on the `+` icon next to the `Channels` heading on the sidebar.

3. **Ask a good question!**

    Imagine you were one of the people reading your question, and ask yourself if you have provided them enough information to give you a helpful answer. For technical issues, have you provided:

    * A brief description of what you're trying to achieve, what your expected outcome is, and what the actual behaviour is.
    * The relevant versions of the software you are using.
    * Details of the environment you're using (Mac/Window/Linux, Docker).
    * Example code.
    * Any relevant logs.
